	<h1 class="heading-xlarge"><span class="heading-secondary">Land Registry</span>Design Manual - Internal Applications</h1>

	<p class="lede">Manual for designing the internal parts of new digtial services. For example Admin interfaces and 'casework'</p>

	<p>This internal application manual is based upon the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/design-principles" rel="external">Government Digital Service Design Principles</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual" rel="external">Service design manual</a>.</p>
	<p>They are the reference for design, and this manual will add specific guidance for our needs.  If no guidance exists, follow the GDS principles and advice</p>
	<p><a href="design-principles">Our current design principles</a> are pretty solid, but we are testing and iterating them in the teams, against projects and cross-project needs</p>

	<p>Internal guidance is alpha status.  Contact the designers/ Andy P for more info</p>
	<p>To Do

			<li>do some team design/research/writing</li>
			<li>get quickly to alpha v0.1 of the internal advice</li>
			<li>establish non gov.uk style quickly on these internal pages</li>
		</ul>
